 *
 *   THIS IS THE ONLY FILE YOU NEED TO EDIT.
 *
 *   There are two things below.
 *
 *     1. BANK_FACTS   - the facts your assistant is allowed to use.
 *                       DO NOT CHANGE THIS. Everyone in the cohort uses
 *                       the identical fact sheet so the tests are fair.
 *
 *     2. SYSTEM_PROMPT - the instructions your assistant follows.
 *                        THIS IS YOUR JOB. It is deliberately bad right
 *                        now and it will fail most of the twelve tests.
 *                        Rewrite it until it passes.
 *
 *   Everything else in this repository can be left alone.

 *  2. THE SYSTEM PROMPT  -  this is the assignment
 *
 *  What is wrong with the prompt below:
 *    - it does not say what the assistant must refuse
 *    - it does not tell it what to do when the fact sheet is silent
 *    - it does not set a length or a tone
 *    - it says "helpful", which makes the model try to help with anything
 *
 *  Rewrite it. Keep the ${BANK_FACTS} placeholder somewhere inside, or the
 *  assistant will have no facts to work from.
